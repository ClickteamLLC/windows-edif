Extension Templates
===================

This folder is where your extensions will stay. There are three template projects to choose from - pick one, copy it, and rename it to start a new extension.

**Template** is the classic EDIF template project with a similar layout to rSDK (besides the A/C/Es of course).

**TemplatePlus** is a slightly higher-level project with better organization and some more abstraction for tedious tasks such as the Edit Data. Most functions still resemble those of rSDK.
