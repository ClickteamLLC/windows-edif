# Extension Development Is Fun
Edif is an alternate extension development SDK for Multimedia Fusion 2 and ClickTeam Fusion 2.5, in which your extension is a true C++ class, with a JSON file (optionally external) to describe it. We recommend that you [check out the wiki](https://github.com/ClickteamLLC/windows-edif/wiki/). If you're new to EDIF, read the [Getting started](https://github.com/ClickteamLLC/windows-edif/wiki/Getting-started) page. There are also some [Tutorials](https://github.com/ClickteamLLC/windows-edif/wiki/Tutorials).
