# Extension Development Is Fun
Edif is an alternate extension development SDK for Multimedia Fusion 2, in which your extension is a true C++ class, with a JSON file (optionally external) to describe it. We recommend that you [check out the wiki](./windows-edif/wiki/). If you're new to EDIF, read the [Getting started](./windows-edif/wiki/Getting-started) page. There are also some [Tutorials](./windows-edif/wiki/Tutorials).
